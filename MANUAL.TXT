COMP 3425 - a CD database application

Author: Shayne Kasai
Date: March 26, 2002

* Introduction
	
	This is an implementation of a database using a non-balanced binary tree.
	Records are stored in a binary file.  The user will have the option to
	modify, add, and view these records.

	The datafile is written to the filename specified at command line.  All data
	in the file is overwritten if the user chooses to write to the file.

* Synopsis

	Usage: cddb filename.dat 
	       
	       where filename.dat is the file to open.

	
* Options
	All options are contained within the menus of the application.
	
* Bugs
	See TODO and BUGS

* Compiling
	
	This assignment has been compiled using GCC for Linux and Mingw
	for the Win32 binary.  It should work with other compilers and
	I'm assuming that it will compile under Cygwin.
